# Insertion sort algrithm
Insertion sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm. It works by building a sorted portion of the array one element at a time. The algorithm repeatedly picks the first element from the unsorted part and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted part. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.
